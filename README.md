# CVE Release Kubernetes Operator

## Overview

The cve-operator is a custom-built Kubernetes operator designed to handle and process CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) hourly releases. The operator monitors GitHub repositories for new CVE releases, processes them, and manages associated Kubernetes Jobs to create vector embeddings in pinecone database.

## Features

### GitHubReleasesMonitor CRD

1. **CRD Creation**: Creates a `GitHubReleasesMonitor` CRD to monitor releases from a GitHub repository.
2. **CRD Fields**:
    - `url`: URL for the GitHub release, e.g., `https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/releases`.
    - `monitorFrom`: Determines the starting point for monitoring:
      - `now`: Check for releases after the creation time of the CRD.
      - `date`: Process all releases from the specified date onwards.
3. **Controller Functionality**:
    - Creates a `GitHubRelease` CR for new releases if one does not already exist.
    - Ignores releases that have already been processed.
    - Sets `finalizers` on the `GitHubRelease` CRs.
4. **CRD Status**:
    - List of releases found on the GitHub repository.
    - Time (in UTC) when the data was retrieved.
    - Value of `monitorFrom` in UTC timestamp format.

### GitHubRelease CRD

1. **CRD Creation**: Creates a `GitHubRelease` CRD to manage processing of CVE releases. The CRD is configured to download the zip file containing `delta` in its name. Other assets are ignored.
2. **Controller Functionality**:
    - Creates a Kubernetes `Job` to process the asset, passing the URL of the `delta` zip file as a parameter.
    - Retries failed Jobs.
    - Ensures the Job is only launched once per CRD and does not run again after success.
3. **Handling Deletions**:
    - If a `GitHubRelease` CR is deleted, the `GitHubReleasesMonitor` controller will re-create it, and the Job will run again.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.22.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kubebuilder:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kubebuilder:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/kubebuilder:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/kubebuilder/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

Create a PR if you would like to contribute to the project

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
